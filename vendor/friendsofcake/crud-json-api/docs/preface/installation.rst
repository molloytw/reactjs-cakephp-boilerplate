Installation
============

Install the JsonApi Listener by running the following command inside your project folder:

.. code-block:: bash

  composer require friendsofcake/crud-json-api

It is highly recommended that you install the ``Search`` plugin as well:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require friendsofcake/search

Loading Crud
------------

Only run the following command if your application does not yet use Crud:

.. code-block:: bash

    bin/cake plugin load Crud

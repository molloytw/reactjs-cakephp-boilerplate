Introduction
============

Use the JsonApi listener to build Crud APIs following the
`JSON API specification <http://jsonapi.org/>`_.

Brings you
----------

* standardized data fetching, data posting and (validation) errors
* a ton of configurable options to manipulate the generated json
* instant compatibility with JSON API supporting tools like Ember Data

Status
------

Even though this listener is used in real applications, some parts of the JSON API
specification have not yet been implemented. Feel free to submit a PR for missing
functionality and help work towards a full-featured implementation of the specification,
the effort should be minimal. See :doc:`Missing Functionality </additional-information/missing-functionality>`
for more information.
